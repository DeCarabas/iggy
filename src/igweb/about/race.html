    <h2>About Races</h2>

    <p>A variety of cultures and societies populate the world of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, some made up of humans
    but others made up of fantastic races such as elves, dwarves, and tieflings.  Adventurers and heroes can arise from
    these various peoples. Your choice of character race provides you with a basic set of advantages and special
    abilities. If you're a fighter, are you a stubborn dwarf monster-slayer, a graceful elf blademaster, or a fierce
    dragonborn gladiator? If you're a wizard, are you a brave human spell-for-hire or a devious tiefling conjurer? Your
    character race not only affects your ability scores and powers but also provides the first cues for building your
    character's story.</p>
