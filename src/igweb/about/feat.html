    <h2>About Feats</h2>

    <p>As you advance in level, you gain a number of benefits that improve your capabilities. These benefits are called
    feats. Typically, a feat doesn't give you a new ability, but instead improves something that you're already able to
    do. A feat might provide a bonus to a skill check, grant a bonus to one of your defense scores, or allow you to
    ignore a particular restriction or penalty in certain situations. Some feats also allow you to use skills in
    different ways, alter the effects of your powers, improve your racial traits, or even grant you capabilities from
    another class.</p>
