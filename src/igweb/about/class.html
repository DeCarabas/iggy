    <h2>About Classes</h2>

    <p>Your class is the primary definition of what your character can 
    do in the extraordinary magical landscape of the Dungeons and Dragons 
    world.</p>

    <p>A class is more than a profession; it is your character's 
    calling. Your class choice shapes every action you take as you adventure 
    across a spell-tangled, monster-ridden, battle-torn fantasy world.</p>
    
    <p>Will you be a gutsy, youthful sword fighter? A pact-sworn warlock
    with questionable ties? A gods-worshiping cleric who knows too much?
    A flamboyant rogue with a dagger up your sleeve? A tatooed wizard with
    a crystal staff? The choice is yours.</p>
