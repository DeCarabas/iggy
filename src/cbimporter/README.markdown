This is a little graphical application that lets me browse
combined.dnd40.xml, which is the data file that forms the heart of the
old Wizards of the Coast character builder program (the one that is
offline, not the silverlight one). It also takes a stab at converting
the XML into JS suitable for pasting into dnd4data.js for igweb.

Eventually it will also be able to do an automated conversion of the
whole thing into JS, for bulk seeding of the data.
